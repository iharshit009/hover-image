Hover Selector
The CSS :hover selector is one of many pseudo-classes that are used to style elements.

The :hover selector is used to select elements when you mouse over them.

The :hover selector can be used on all elements, not only on links.

The hover selector only applies the styles provided in the rule when the element enters the hover state. 
That is when the user hovers over the element with their mouse.

for any button on which the user's pointer is hovering-
            button:hover
            {
            css declarations;
            }
for hovering over any image with class="xyz"-
            .xyz:hover
            {
            css declarations;
            }
